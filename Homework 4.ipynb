While this may or may not be accuracte, it's a great idea for a programming problem :) If you're not familiar with this concept - [this]( https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/how-to-calculate-your-dogs-age) is a great article. \n",

    "## Your task\n",
    "Write a Python program to convert a dog's age to human years.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, you need to create a function called `to_human_years(dog_years)` that accepts an integer `dog_years` and returns a `float` / decimal number which represents the age in human years.\n",

    "### Rule to convert age from human years to dog years - \n",
